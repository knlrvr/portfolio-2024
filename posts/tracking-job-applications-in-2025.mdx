You know what's worse than job hunting? Tracking your job applications in a spreadsheet. 

There's something uniquely *soul-crushing* about opening a spreadsheet after each job application 
to log yet another entry into the void. Every time I opened that spreadsheet in 2024, it felt less 
like organizing my job search and more like *documenting my rejection journey*. 

So, I did what any reasonable software developer would do &mdash; I massively over-engineered a different 
solution. 


## The "Better" Way (TL;DR)

Instead of using any of the perfectly suitable apps (like Numbers, Excel, or even Sheets), I built 
a workflow in GitHub that automatically updates a <InlineCode>README.md</InlineCode> file via a Node.js script in <InlineCode>update-readme.js</InlineCode> whenever I 
add a new job object to <InlineCode>jobs.json</InlineCode>. 

Instead of opening a spreadsheet, picture this &mdash;
- Open the code editor 
- Update the JSON file
- Commit and push to GitHub
- GitHub Actions runs the Node.js script
- The README is updated with a table of all json content

Is it efficient? Absolutely not. Is it fun? Well, it's at least more fun that staring at a color-coded spreadsheet. 


## The Technical Bits

### jobs.json

This is where the data is. Each job is an object with fields like company name, role, etc. It looks something like this &mdash;

```
[
  {
    "company_name": "Company A", 
    "role": "Software Engineer ",
    "locations": [
      "NYC"
    ],
    "date_applied": "12/26/24",
    "url": "url-to-candidate-portal",
    "company_url": "url-to-company-website"
  }
]
```

### README.md 

This is where the data gets displayed. This file contains a description of the project, but it also contains special 'flags' that tell the script where to inject the table. 

```md
<!-- START_TABLE -->
<!-- END_TABLE -->
```

### update-readme.js

This is where the magic happens! We're doing quite a bit here &mdash;
   - Validate that all files exist. 
   - Read & validate the JSON (because who hasn't accidentally written invalid JSON?)
   - Generate the markdown table
   - Update the table in the README while preserving everything else

Here's a bit of the <InlineCode>update-readme.js</InlineCode> file &mdash;

```js
    let jobs;
    try {
      jobs = JSON.parse(jobsData);
      if (!Array.isArray(jobs)) {
        throw new Error('Jobs data is not an array');
      }
    } catch (e) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to parse jobs.json: ${e.message}`);
    }

    let markdownTable = '| Company | Role | Location | Date Applied | Portal |\n';
    markdownTable += '| ------- | ---- | -------- | ------------ | ------ |\n';
    
    for (const job of jobs) {
      const requiredFields = ['company_name', 'role', 'locations', 'date_applied', 'url', 'company_url'];
      for (const field of requiredFields) {
        if (!job[field]) {
          throw new Error(`Missing required field "${field}" in job for ${job.company_name || 'unknown company'}`);
        }
      }

      markdownTable += `| [${job.company_name}](${job.company_url}) | ${job.role} | ${Array.isArray(job.locations) ? job.locations.join(', ') : job.locations} | ${job.date_applied} | [Portal](${job.url}) |\n`;
}
```

### GitHub Actions workflow

Automation. Every time <InlineCode>jobs.json</InlineCode> changes, it runs the script and updates the <InlineCode>README.md</InlineCode> with the new table.

## The Actual Benefit

This might seem like a ridiculous way to track job applications, but it actually has some benefits &mdash;
- **Automation Practice**: It's a playground for GitHub Actions and automation (I used JavaScript but you could use another language). 
- **Portfolio Piece**: It's a real-world project that showcases knowledge in automated workflows and handling data (and maybe a sense of humor?)


## Conclusion

Is this the worst way to track job applications? Probably. But sometimes the worst solutions are the most fun to build. At the end of the day, at least it's not a fucking spreadsheet.
