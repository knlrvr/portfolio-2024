When I felt reasonably comfortable with my knowledge in React, I, of course, moved on to learning a framework. I didn't even know where to start. I did what any dev would do &mdash; **I googled it**. I chose the framework that seemed to have the most support, and was aligned with what I wanted from React &mdash; **Next.js**. 

Next.js is an absolute powerhouse. It provides a ton of features out-of-the-box, and even though you might not need them all, it can be pretty intimidating if you don't understand them. 

I want to go over one of the simpler Next.js features &mdash; **routing**.

<Disclaimer>
  **Disclaimer** &mdash; This is not a comprehensive breakdown of Next.js or the features it provides. This is only an outline of my experience with a single feature in Next.js. If you've had a different experience, please feel free to let me know! 
</Disclaimer>

## Routing 
Next.js refers to routing as 'the skeleton of every application', and uses a file-system based router to handle the behavior. 

There have been a lot of changes and additions with the introduction of Next.js 13 which, at the time of this blog post, is the most recent update from the framework. The most significant change is the new app directory, which handles routing for Next applications. Basically, the new app directory has a lot more flexibility and ease-of-use than the previous pages directory. 

So what's the difference? What *exactly* is the benefit of the new app directory? Or should you just keep using the pages directory? Could you use *both*? 

## Pages
To outline some of the differences between the directories, we'll use a portfolio as an example. Using the **pages** directory, the structure looks a little like this &mdash;

```
└── pages     
    ├── index.tsx     
    ├── about.tsx     
    ├── contact.tsx        
    └── work.tsx   
```

Next.js will treat files in the **pages** directory as routes, provided that the files are React Components exported from a **.js**, **.ts**, **.jsx** or **.tsx** file.

For example, if the code below was in our **about.tsx** file, it will be accessible at **url/about**.

```jsx
export default function About() {
  return <div>About Page</div>
}
```

Pages was *the* way to create routes in Next.js before the introduction of the App router. The Pages directory offers a simple and straight forward approach to handle routing in a Next.js application, but has a defining limitation &mdash;

**It's simple**. The simplicity of the pages directory is both it's greatest and worst feature. It's ideal for smaller applications with simple, static pages but becomes difficult to use in larger applications with advanced routing & layouts, dynamic pages, etc. Essentially, the pages directory is simple and is best used for simple applications. You can certainly find workarounds to complete more complex tasks, but at that point, you may benefit from using the app directory. 

## App
Using the **app** directory, the structure of a portfolio might look more like this &mdash;

```
src/     
└── app     
    ├── page.tsx     
    ├── globals.css     
    ├── layout.tsx    
    ├── work
    │   └── [url]        
    │       └── page.tsx 
    ├── about     
    │   └── page.tsx     
    └── contact     
        └── page.tsx    
```

###### The use of a folder in square brackets indicates a dynamic route. The name inside of the square brackets corresponds to the parameter we want to capture for the URL. 

The app router works in a new directory named **app**. In app, **folders** define the routes of your application, from a root folder down to a leaf folder. So, the previous route we defined in **pages** would instead be **app/about/page.tsx**. 

The app router includes new support for shared layouts, server components, streaming, and data fetching. It's a great answer to the issues introduced by the Pages directory, but does also come with its own limitation &mdash; 

**It's a little more complex**. The biggest issue introduced by the app router is it's complexity. There's a bit of a learning curve in adopting new techniques and finding new ways to do things that were done another way in the pages directory. However, in my opinion, the benefit provided by the app router far outweighs the complexity and learning curve.

## So Which Directory Should You Use?
I would certainly recommend using the app router for any new projects you may create, and trying to adopt it for your existing work. 

From my experience, and what I've been able to gather from others, it might seem more convenient to stick with pages for smaller projects and app for larger projects, but I would recommend using the app router *regardless* of project size. 

## Using Both Directories
The app router works alongside the pages directory to allow for incremental adoption of the new router, so it's really only advised to use both during migration. 

###### Tip &mdash; When using both directories, you do have to be mindful of the different behaviors in layouts, state management, metadata, routing hooks, data fetching, etc. More about that below. 

For example, I used the **pages** directory in my previous portfolio to showcase my projects. This was all handled in a file named **[url].tsx** that was located in the pages directory. Within that file, I use two functions that aren't supported in the app directory &mdash; *getStaticProps* & *getStaticPaths*. 

### In Pages &mdash;

*getStaticProps* tells Next.js to pre-render the page at build time using the props returned by *getStaticProps*. Here it is in action &mdash;

```jsx
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const url = params?.url as string;
  const projectData: Project = await fetchProjectData(url);

  return {
    props: {
      projectData,
    },
  };
};
```

*getStaticPaths* tells Next.js to statically pre-render all the paths specified by *getStaticPaths*. A page with dynamic routes that uses *getStaticProps* needs to define a list of paths to be statically generated. Here's that function in use as well &mdash; 

```jsx
export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  const paths = [
    { params: { url: 'theviewfrominside' } },
    { params: { url: 'keepup' } },
    { params: { url: 'abstract' } },
    { params: { url: 'theskyisfake'} },
    { params: { url: 'personalportfolio' } },
    { params: { url: 'ttrpcompanion' } },
  ];

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
};
```

### In App &mdash;
In the app directory, *getStaticPaths* is replaced with *generateStaticParams*, simplifying route parameters, so the function might look something like this &mdash;

```jsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
    return [
        { url: 'theviewfrominside' },
        { url: 'keepup' },
        // other paths
    ]
}
```

I also didn't really need to use getStaticProps at all since I'm not fetching data from an API or backend of any kind. I just wrote a function with hardcoded data and called that function in the main component so it would only return the information for the project that matched the url (*the magic of params*).

```jsx
export default async function WorksPage(
{
    params, 
}: {
    params: { 
        url: string
    };
}) {

    const projects = fetchWorksData(params.url);

    return (
      // main component code
      <p className="font-migra text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-7xl">{projects.title}</p>
    )
}

const fetchWorksData = (url: string): Project => {
  const projectDataMap: { [key: string]: Project } = {

    projectOne: {
      // data for projectOne like title, description, image, etc. 
    },
    projectTwo: {
      // data for projectTwo
    }
    // more projects
  }
}
```

My previous portfolio was migrated to the new app router with the support of <BlogLink href='https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration'>these Next.js docs &nearr;</BlogLink>. It was a relatively easy process, but there are some important notes about behaviors to be mindful of that I went through during the migration. 

For example, if you changed the theme and then navigated to any of the **/work** pages, the theme would revert to it's default setting, which was dependent on the time of day. The theme wasn't persisting between my projects in the pages router, and the rest of the site in the app router. 

Another example is how metadata is added. In the pages directory, we simply used the Head component provided by Next.js &mdash;

```jsx
<Head>
  <meta property='og:title' content={`Kane Lariviere | ${projectData.title}`} key='title' />
  <meta property='og:image' content='https://knlrvr.dev/og-bg-2.png' />
</Head>
```

In the app directory, we have a few options. To define static metadata, we would export a **Metadata** object &mdash;

```jsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Kane Lariviere | Portfolio',
  description: 'Kane Lariviere • Software Engineer. Full Stack Developer. Designer.',
}
```

That's still pretty simple, right? If we had dynamic metadata, we could also use the *generateMetadata* function &mdash;

```jsx
export async function generateMetadata({ 
    params
}: any): Promise<Metadata | undefined> {
    let post = getPostMetadata().find((post) => post.slug === params.slug);
    
    if (!post) {
        return;
    }

    let {
        title,
        description,
        image,
    } = post;

    let ogImage = image
    ? `https://knlrvr.dev${image}`
    : `https://knlrvr.dev/og?title=${title}`

    return {
        title, 
        description,
        openGraph: {
            title, 
            description,
            type: 'article',
            url: `https://knlrvr.dev/blog/${post.slug}`,
            images: [
                {
                    url: ogImage,
                }
            ]
        },
        twitter: {
            card: 'summary_large_image',
            title, 
            description,
            images: [ogImage]
        },
    };
}
```

The **generateMetadata** function returns a **Metadata** object with one or more metadata fields like **title** & **description**, which is what is used to define the metadata for the dynamic page. 

I think these differences do a good job of showcasing the trade offs between directories. The app router might seem a little more complex, but you can do *so much more* with it. 

I certainly wouldn't *recommend* using both routers, but it's certainly possible, and necessary if you're needing to incrementally adopt the app router.
